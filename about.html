          <h3>Intro</h3>
          <!-- show passion, teamwork, personality outside of coding. -->
          <p>Hi there! My name is Terrance and I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer currently living in southern California. I've always had a deep curiosity for the way things work and I'm also a creative. Programming has allowed me a perfect medium to express both outlets because that's what programming is&mdash; coming up with creative solutions to logical problems.</p>
          <p>When I'm not hacking away at the computer I'm doing my second favorite thing, helping others! I have a genuine passion for teaching and helping others and I express this passion through my personal blog and by mentoring other developers.</p>
          <p>Other interests of mine include exercising, reading, video games, drinking a hot cup of herbal tea, and fiddling around on the keyboard (the music kind).</p>

                <p>Terrance and I worked together many times while at Thinkful, most notably for final project. Terrance's ability to rally and guide our team that had no official leader was invaluable. He played a vital role in planning and developing the front-end of our application, solved problems that stumped others, and seemed to successfully juggle several other personal projects while still working full-time on ours.</p>

                <p>Terrance brings an awesome skill set to the table. Working with him in a SCRUM environment was a pleasure. He has an articulate eye for design, both visually and behind the scenes. Always willing to help out and be a "team player", he has inspired and pushed me to be a better developer.</p>
                <p>He finds the time to make everything come together and has the ability to learn and apply new technical aspect to a project. His camaraderie, positivity, and motivation set him apart from the crowd.</p>

                <p>I worked with Terrance on several projects throughout my time at Thinkful. Terrance is eager to learn, communicates well, and works hard. Before class even began, I could tell he was excited about coding. We would often exchange learning resources and tips on anything code -- the terminal, JavaScript, Node, add-ons to our text editors. He was always very positive and encouraging whenever we got stuck during our paired-programming workshops.</p>
                <p>When debugging issues in our code, I could tell he had a great sense of clarity on his work. He knew where to look for errors, looked up documentation when necessary and asked for help when needed. It was a pleasure working with Terrance. I think anyone would benefit from having him on their team.</p>
